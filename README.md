# colorGenerator
A random color generator for hexadecimal and RGB values.

This project is a random color generator. It's an offshoot of John Smilga's basic JavaScript "color flipper."

I added:
  - support for RGB values
  - the math to convert hex to RGB

In progress:
  - maintaining the color as you switch from RGB to Hex pages

Next steps:
  - building the reverse
      * loading the RBG values into the hex page
      * RGB to hex math conversion


The project would be more use to me if it maintained its randomly generated color when you switched between the pages, so that's what I'm doing.
