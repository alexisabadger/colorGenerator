# colorGenerator
A random color generator for hexadecimal and RGB values.

This project is a random color generator. It's an offshoot of John Smilga's basic JavaScript "color flipper."

I added:
  - support for RGB values
  - the math to convert hex to RGB

In progress:
  - maintaining the color as you switch from RGB to Hex pages

Next steps:
  - building the reverse
      * loading the RBG values into the hex page
      * RGB to hex math conversion
