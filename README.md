# colorGenerator
a random color generator for hexadecimal and RGB values

Hello, world!

This project is a random color generator. It's an offshoot of John Smilga's basic JavaScript "color flipper."

I added:
  - support for RGB values

In progress:
  - maintaining the color as you switch from RGB to Hex pages
