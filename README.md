# colorGenerator
A random color generator for hexadecimal and RGB values.

This project is a random color generator. It's an offshoot of John Smilga's basic JavaScript "color flipper."

I added:
  - support for RGB values
  - the math to convert hex to RGB
  - persistance of values in the browser as you switch between hex and RGB values (note: needs cookies to work)
